# Unity-FOV-Terrain-Generator
Generates terrain based on camera fov

Getting Started
Project made with Unity 2018.2.04b

The scripts should be able to be taken out and used with any version of unity though.


The generator scripts are in the fovTerrainGenerator folder.

In the components folder is he TerrainStreamer component. Put this on any game object and add a camera and a Terrain or Plane object as the terrain.

In the classes folder is TerrainsInTriangle <- this is where the main calculations happen. 

If you have any suggestions of ways to optomize, let me know.

Enjoy!
